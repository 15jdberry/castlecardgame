	y for yes: y

GAME RULES:
    THE FIRST PLAYER TO RUN OUT OF CARDS WINS!
    1.  3 cards are dealt to each player face-down (Hidden Cards).
    2.  3 cards are dealt to each player face-up (Face-Up Cards).
    3.  3 cards are dealt to each player's Hand.
    4.  The first card is turned over from the shuffled deck and becomes the
        Active Card.
    5.  During their turn, each player will play a card that is equal to
        or of higher value than the active card.
        --- 2's, 8's, and A's play on top of any card
        --- 2's reset the stack
        --- 8's burn the stack and remove it from play
        --- A's have the highest card value
    6.  You must play a card during your turn. If you cannot play a card,
        type 99 to pick up the current stack. The next player can play any
        card from their choices.
    7.  Burn the stack if:
        --- The top 4 cards are of the same value, and/or
        --- An 8 is played
        The player who played the last card will restart their turn.
    8.  Once your turn is finished, if there is still a deck,
        you will draw cards from the draw pile (deck) to maintain 3 cards in your hand.
    9. Once the deck is depleted, players rely solely on the cards
        in their hand.
        --- If you pick up the stack, you must play all of those cards before
            playing from your cards on the table (Hidden and Face-Up Cards).
        --- Once your Hand is depleted, you will play from your Face-Up Cards.
        --- Once your Face-Up Cards are depleted, you will play from your
            Hidden Cards.
        --- You win the game if you deplete your Hand, Face-Up, and Hidden Cards
            before your opponent

NOTES ABOUT THIS VERSION:
    [A] Players CANNOT choose their 3 Face-Up Cards.
    [B] 10's are NOT special cards. They will NOT add the burnt stack back
        to the game.
    [C] By default, you will play all cards of the same value from your hand.
    [D] You will NOT be able to play a 4-of-a-kind from your hand unless
        those cards are of equal or higher value than the active card.
    [E] KeyboardInterrupt is supported.
